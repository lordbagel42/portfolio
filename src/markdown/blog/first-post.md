## Markdown

Hey friends! ðŸ‘‹

This is mostly a test post, just to see how things work together.
I am using Sveltekit, mdsvex, and Shiki to write these blog posts. It's all just simple markdown!

Eventually, I'll write a web-based editor, but I don't want to deal with implementing my auth system in a cloudflare worker right now.
I might just use zero trust to do it, but I'm not certain.
https://editor.sylviethedev.com/ could be neat. I could just make it a vscode web server, no clue what's best though.

```ts
function greet(name: string) {
	console.log(`Hey ${name}! ðŸ‘‹`);
}
```
